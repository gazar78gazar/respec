# Change Summary (2026-01-07 to 2026-01-11)

Short, proud recap of the jump made between Jan 7 and now.

## At-a-Glance Metrics
- Files changed: 80
- Total insertions: 8065
- Total deletions: 16783
- High-churn threshold: 500 lines changed (adds + deletes)

## Logic Changes (Human-Readable)
- Removed legacy UC1/older UC8 assets and long-form docs to focus the repo on the current UC8 spec-only pipeline.
- Shifted UC8 data into config, and tightened UI + service wiring around spec-only selections (P## + C## + spec exclusions).
- Formalized the LLM path around PreSaleEngineer with threaded sessions (ConversationService + SessionStore), separating stateless conflict-choice parsing.
- Hardened artifact sync: immediate conflict checks, dependency assumptions, and respec-driven form updates keep the UI aligned.
- Refined prompts and conflict handling so resolution is consistently triggered and applied through RespecService.

## README.md Evolution (What the docs say changed)

Key documentation moves reflected the real logic changes:
- Runtime flow updated to show PreSaleEngineer + artifact sync replacing the older semantic matching path.
- Lines refined to reflect threaded extraction, stateless conflict parsing, and respec delta updates.
- Data location corrected (UC8 moved to src/config), and session/storage notes aligned with current services.
