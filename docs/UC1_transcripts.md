### Context
Expert user configuring a substation thermal monitoring system with AI-based hot spot detection.

### Conversation Flow

**User:** I need a controller for our substation thermal monitoring system with AI-based hot spot detection

**System:** Hi, I understand. Will this system only monitor temperatures, or does it also need to control protection equipment like circuit breakers?

**User:** Both - it needs to monitor thermal cameras and trigger protection systems when hot spots are detected

**System:** Perfect. What interfaces do your thermal cameras use? Are they sending digital signal, or USB3 Vision, or else?

**User:** We have USB3 Vision cameras, but I'd like digital ports as backup

**System:** Got it. How many digital outputs do you need for protection relay triggers? What's the maximum acceptable response time from detection to trigger?

**User:** We need 16 digital outputs for protection relay triggers. Response time must be under 100ms for critical faults

**System:** Excellent! So we need an industrial PC with 4 USB3 ports, 4 digital backup ports, and additional 16 digital outputs with <50ms response time. Do you have any other IO requirements, or should we discuss performance specifications?

**User:** We also need IEC 61850 protocol support for SCADA integration

**System:** IEC 61850, got it. Will you need redundant network ports for high availability? Do you require modbus support?

**User:** Yes to both - dual redundant Ethernet and modbus

**System:** Perfect! We have: GigE Vision cameras, USB3 backup, 16 DIO, IEC 61850 with modbus, redundant Ethernet. Ready to move to performance requirements?

**User:** Yes, let's continue

**System:** Given the AI processing for thermal imaging, do you need GPU acceleration? What's your target frame rate for image processing?

**User:** We need to process 30 fps from each camera with 98% accuracy. GPU would be good

**System:** That requires significant processing power. Would an Intel i7 with integrated GPU work, or do you need a dedicated GPU? How much storage for thermal image history?

**User:** Lets go for the i7. We need at least 1TB for 30 days of recordings

**System:** Excellent. We're looking at an i7 processor, dedicated GPU, 1TB NVMe storage, suitable for AI thermal analysis at 30fps. Any other performance requirements or shall we discuss environmental specifications?

**User:** What about memory requirements?

**System:** For AI processing with 4 cameras, I'd recommend 32GB RAM minimum. This ensures smooth operation with your image processing algorithms.

**System:** Let's discuss environment. What's the installation location - indoor cabinet or outdoor enclosure? What temperature range?

**User:** Indoor electrical cabinet, but temperatures can reach 50°C in summer

**System:** 50°C requires extended temperature rating. Will the cabinet have ventilation, or do you need fanless operation? Any specific IP rating required?

**User:** Cabinet has some ventilation but dusty environment. IP20 minimum please

**System:** Understood. Environmental requirements: Extended temp to 50°C, IP20 protection, suitable for dusty conditions. What is your budget and timeline?

## Use Case 1 - Domain 2: Compact DIN Rail Mount (Uncertain User)

### Context
Less experienced user needing basic electrical monitoring in a substation with space constraints.

### Conversation Flow

**User:** Need something for electrical monitoring in our substation

**System:** I'll help you find the right substation monitoring solution. Are you monitoring only or do you also need to control equipment?

**User:** I'm not entirely sure. We want to track voltage and current, maybe send alarms?

**System:** That sounds like monitoring with alarm capabilities. Let's assume basic monitoring with digital outputs for alarms. You can always upgrade later.

**System:** How many measurement points do you need? Are you using current transformers (CTs) or voltage transformers (VTs)?

**User:** We have 3 phases to monitor, so 3 CTs and 3 VTs I guess?

**System:** Ok. That's 6 analog inputs total. Do these output 0-5V signals or 4-20mA current loops?

**User:** How do I check that?

**System:** Check relevant documentation. For now, let's assume 4-20mA as it's most common. You can always check and change later.

**System:** Do you have space constraints in your electrical panel? Do you prefer DIN rail or rack mount?

**User:** Very limited space. DIN rail would be much better

**System:** Perfect. What's the maximum depth available behind the DIN rail? How many alarm outputs do you need?

**User:** Maybe 100mm depth? Need 4 alarm relays minimum

**System:** Doable. So we need: compact DIN rail PC, 6 analog inputs, 4 digital relay outputs, <100mm depth. Any network requirements?

**User:** Needs to connect to our SCADA system via Ethernet

**System:** Good. Does your SCADA use Modbus or other protocol? Single or redundant Ethernet?

**User:** Modbus TCP. Single port is fine

**System:** Excellent! Compact DIN mount with 6 AI, 4 DO, Modbus TCP, single Ethernet. Ready for performance specifications?

**User:** Sure

**System:** For basic monitoring, will a low-power processor work? How often do you need to sample the measurements?

**User:** What's typical for power monitoring?

**System:** Typically a low power Atom processor handles this easily and keeps costs down.

**System:** How much historical data storage do you need? Do you prefer cost-effective 64GB or larger capacity?

**User:** 64GB should be plenty, we archive to SCADA anyway

**System:** Smart choice. Atom processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage - efficient and economical. Any special performance needs or move to environment?

**User:** Let's continue

**System:** What's the ambient temperature? Is it climate controlled or not?

**User:** No climate control. Gets pretty warm in summer, maybe 45°C?

**System:** 45°C requires extended temperature range. Given the compact space, fanless operation is mandatory. Any vibration concerns?

**User:** Some vibration from nearby transformers

**System:** I'll specify 2G vibration resistance for transformer environments. Environmental summary: fanless, extended temp to 45°C, 2G vibration. What's your budget for this? Timeline?

### Context
User configuring a digital protection system for distribution substation with budget constraints requiring creative solution.

### Conversation Flow

**User:** Need a protection controller for our distribution substation, only digital signals

**System:** Are you monitoring breaker positions and relay contacts only, or also controlling switching operations?

**User:** Both monitoring and control. Need to interface with 24 protective relays and control 8 circuit breakers

**System:** Comprehensive protection scheme. How many digital inputs for relay status monitoring? How many outputs for breaker control?

**User:** 48 digital inputs from relays, 16 digital outputs for breaker control and alarms

**System:** High I/O count noted. Do your protective relays use IEC 61850? Do you need redundant communication paths for reliability?

**User:** All relays support IEC 61850, and redundant Ethernet with automatic failover. Also modbus tcp for the SCADA connection

**System:** Excellent redundancy planning. Summary: 48 DI, 16 DO, IEC 61850 modbus tcp, redundant Ethernet. Any other protocols?

**User:** That covers it for protocols

**System:** Perfect. Ready to discuss performance requirements?

**User:** Yes

**System:** You probably need real-time processing. Will Intel i7 with 16GB RAM do?

**User:** Continue

**System:** Installation location - indoor control house or outdoor cabinet? What's your temperature range?

**User:** Indoor control house with HVAC. Standard temperature control 15-35°C

**System:** Controlled environment simplifies requirements. Standard commercial temperature rating sufficient? Any vibration from transformers?

**User:** Standard rating is fine. Minimal vibration in control house

**System:** Environment: Standard 15-35°C, minimal vibration, indoor installation. What is your budget for this and when do you need it for installation?

**User:** We only have $2,200 approved. If we could have it within 4-6 weeks that'd be fine.

**System:** **BUDGET CONFLICT DETECTED** - Your requirements exceed budget by $600-2,000. Would you prefer to remove redundant power supplies, reduce CPU, Memory, or to request additional budget approval for full protection requirements?

**User:** I cannot remove the power redundancy, and I can only go as high as $2,200, subject to my manager's approval. How else can we match the solution to our budget?

**System:** Let's go for Core i5 with 8GB memory, should also hold, excluding the operating system, which you may already have a license for - this seems to be within your budget of $2,200.
