# Sprint 2 Week 1 - Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 2, 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Testing
**Version**: 1.0

---

## 🎯 **Implementation Summary**

Sprint 2 Week 1 successfully implements the foundational architecture for LLM-based semantic matching to UC1 schema with confidence scoring. The implementation follows the revised plan and maintains separation between Agent extraction and UC1 matching.

---

## ✅ **Completed Tasks**

### **1. SemanticMatchingService.ts** ✅
**File**: `src/services/respec/semantic/SemanticMatchingService.ts`

**Purpose**: Stateless LLM for UC1 semantic matching

**Key Features**:
- `matchExtractedNodesToUC1()` - Main matching method
- Loads full UC1 schema on every call (MVP approach)
- Returns matches with confidence scores (0.0-1.0)
- Supports domain, requirement, and specification matching
- Provides match rationale and match type (exact/fuzzy/semantic)

**Interfaces**:
```typescript
interface ExtractedNode {
  text: string;
  category?: string;
  value?: any;
  context?: string;
}

interface MatchResult {
  extractedNode: ExtractedNode;
  uc1Match: UC1Match;
  value?: any;
}

interface UC1Match {
  id: string;               // e.g., 'spc001', 'req001', 'dom001'
  name: string;             // e.g., 'processor_type'
  type: 'domain' | 'requirement' | 'specification';
  confidence: number;       // 0.0 - 1.0
  matchType: 'exact' | 'fuzzy' | 'semantic';
  rationale?: string;
}
```

### **2. AnthropicService.ts Updates** ✅
**File**: `src/services/respec/AnthropicService.ts`

**Changes**: Integrated conversational flow prompt into `buildSystemPrompt()`

**Added Features**:
- Guided questions for use case, I/O, communication, performance, environment, commercial
- "I don't know" handling with assumptions (confidence=0.6)
- Category completion tracking (summarize every 4 extractions or 75% completion)
- Binary/multichoice question format
- Context-aware question progression

**Sample Questions**:
- Use Case: "What is the primary use case for this system?"
- I/O: "How many analog inputs do you need?"
- Communication: "What communication protocols do you need?"
- Performance: "What response times do you need?"
- Environment: "What is the ambient temperature range?"
- Commercial: "What is your budget per unit?"

### **3. SemanticIntegrationService_NEW.ts** ✅
**File**: `src/services/respec/semantic/SemanticIntegrationService_NEW.ts`

**Purpose**: Integration layer between Agent and Matcher

**Key Method**: `processExtractedRequirements(extractedRequirements, conversationalResponse)`

**Flow**:
1. Receives already-extracted requirements from Agent
2. Converts to `ExtractedNode` format
3. Routes to `SemanticMatchingService` for UC1 matching
4. Filters by confidence threshold (default: 0.7)
5. Routes matches by node type (logging only for Week 1)
6. Converts UC1 matches to form updates (specifications only)
7. Returns enhanced result with form updates

**Routing Logic (Week 1 - Logging Only)**:
```typescript
switch (uc1Match.type) {
  case 'specification':
    console.log(`[Route] 🎯 SPECIFICATION: ${uc1Match.id} = ${value}`);
    // TODO Week 2: artifact management
    break;
  case 'requirement':
    console.log(`[Route] 📋 REQUIREMENT: ${uc1Match.id}`);
    // TODO Week 2: artifact management
    break;
  case 'domain':
    console.log(`[Route] 🏢 DOMAIN: ${uc1Match.id}`);
    // TODO Week 2: artifact management
    break;
}
```

**Form Update Rules**:
- Only specifications can update form
- Requirements and domains are logged but don't update form (Week 1)
- Week 2 will add child specs as system assumptions

---

### **4. SimplifiedRespecService.ts Updates** ✅
**File**: `src/services/respec/SimplifiedRespecService.ts`

**Changes**: Updated `processChatMessage()` to use Sprint 2 flow

**New Flow**:
```
User Input
  ↓
Step 1: Agent extracts requirements (AnthropicService.analyzeRequirements)
  ↓
Step 2: Route to SemanticIntegrationService_NEW.processExtractedRequirements()
  ↓
Step 3: Matcher matches to UC1 (SemanticMatchingService.matchExtractedNodesToUC1)
  ↓
Step 4: Convert matches to form updates
  ↓
Return enhanced result to UI
```

**Error Handling**: Fail fast (throw error) instead of fallback to patterns

**Console Logging**:
- `[SimplifiedRespec] 🚀 Starting Sprint 2 flow`
- `[SimplifiedRespec] 📝 Step 1: Agent extracting requirements...`
- `[SimplifiedRespec] ✅ Agent extracted: X requirements`
- `[SimplifiedRespec] 🔍 Step 2: Routing to SemanticIntegrationService...`
- `[SimplifiedRespec] ✅ Sprint 2 processing complete: X form updates`

---

### **5. Validation Test Script** ✅
**File**: `test-sprint2-week1-validation.cjs`

**Purpose**: Structural validation of Sprint 2 Week 1 implementation

**Checks**:
1. ✅ Environment configuration (API key, model name)
2. ✅ File structure (all new services exist)
3. ✅ SemanticMatchingService structure (methods and interfaces)
4. ✅ SemanticIntegrationService structure
5. ✅ AnthropicService conversational flow integration
6. ✅ SimplifiedRespecService Sprint 2 flow
7. ✅ Routing logic (logging for Week 1)
8. ✅ UC1 schema context preparation
9. ✅ Form update filtering (specifications only)

**Result**: ✅ All validations PASSED

---

## 📊 **Validation Results**

## 🔍 **Key Architectural Decisions**

### **1. Agent vs Matcher Separation**
- ✅ **Agent (AnthropicService)**: Extracts requirements from user input
- ✅ **Matcher (SemanticMatchingService)**: Matches extractions to UC1 schema
- ✅ **Integration Layer**: Fault isolation and logging

### **2. UC1 Schema Loading**
- ✅ Full UC1 schema loaded on every matching call
- ✅ MVP approach: Simplicity over token cost optimization
- ✅ Week 2 can optimize if needed

### **3. Form Update Trigger**
- ✅ Process Logic (Imperative) approach
- ✅ Specifications update form immediately
- ✅ Requirements/domains will update child specs in Week 2

### **4. Error Handling**
- ✅ Fail fast on LLM errors
- ✅ No fallback to pattern matching
- ✅ Immediate visibility of issues for debugging

### **5. Week 1 Scope**
- ✅ Extraction + Matching + Form Updates
- ✅ Logging for routing (no artifact management)
- ⏳ Week 2: Artifact management + Conflict detection

---

## 📝 **Week 1 vs Week 2 Scope**

### **Week 1 (COMPLETE)** ✅
- ✅ SemanticMatchingService created
- ✅ Agent conversational flow integrated
- ✅ SemanticIntegrationService routing
- ✅ SimplifiedRespecService wired
- ✅ Form updates for specifications
- ✅ Logging for all node types
- ✅ Fail-fast error handling

### **Week 2 (NEXT)** ⏳
- ⏳ Artifact management (mapped/respec artifacts)
- ⏳ Conflict detection service
- ⏳ Binary question generation for conflicts
- ⏳ Requirement → child specs population
- ⏳ Domain → descendant specs population
- ⏳ System assumptions (confidence < 0.9)

---

## 🐛 **Known Issues & Limitations**

### **Week 1 Limitations (Expected)**
1. **No Artifact Management**: Requirements/domains are logged but not stored
2. **No Conflict Detection**: Will be implemented in Week 2
3. **Specifications Only**: Form only updates with specifications, not requirements/domains
4. **No Child Spec Population**: Requirements/domains don't populate their children yet

### **Pre-Existing Issues (Not in Sprint 2 Scope)**
- Multiple TypeScript errors in app.tsx (pre-existing)
- Unused legacy methods in SimplifiedRespecService (cleanup deferred)

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### **Immediate**
1. Test manually with UC1 transcripts
2. Verify console logs show Sprint 2 flow
3. Confirm form updates work for specifications
4. Test conversational flow with various inputs

### **Week 2 Preparation**
1. Design ArtifactManager interface
2. Design ConflictDetectionService interface
3. Plan binary question generation
4. Review UC1 hierarchy for child spec population
