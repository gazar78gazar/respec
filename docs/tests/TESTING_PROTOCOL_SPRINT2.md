# Sprint 2 Week 1 - Step-by-Step Testing Protocol
**Date**: October 2, 2025
**Purpose**: Diagnose and fix identified issues based on user observations

---

## üéØ **Issues to Investigate** (Based on Your Feedback)

### **Issue 1: UC1 Matching Accuracy** üî¥ **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Your Observation**: "Successfully matched 3 out of 6 (should have matched 5 out of 6)"

**Hypothesis**: SemanticMatchingService LLM prompt may not be optimal for matching

### **Issue 2: Form Update Coherence** üî¥ **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Your Observation**:
- "Updated some specifications successfully, some not successfully or not at all"
- "Matched wall mount when I never spoke of any mount"
- "It updated two form fields I discussed (with wrong values)"
- "When I asked what it filled, it said it didn't fill the form fields"

**Hypothesis**: Agent lacks visibility into form updates OR form update flow has issues

### **Issue 3: Conversation Context** üî¥ **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Your Observation**: "Conversation context is indeed absent beyond the last message"

**Hypothesis**: conversationHistory not passed correctly to Agent

---

## üìã **Testing Protocol - Execute in This Order**

### **TEST 1: Conversation Context Verification** ‚ö° **DO THIS FIRST**

**Goal**: Verify conversationHistory is passed to Agent

**Steps**:
1. Open browser DevTools Console (F12)
2. Clear console
3. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Wait for app to load
5. Enter message: **"I need 16 digital inputs"**
6. Press Send
7. **CHECK CONSOLE** for these logs (copy and paste output):
   ```
   [SimplifiedRespec] Processing: "I need 16 digital inputs"
   [SimplifiedRespec] üöÄ Starting Sprint 2 flow
   [SimplifiedRespec] üìù Step 1: Agent extracting requirements...
   ```
8. Enter follow-up message: **"and 8 digital outputs"**
9. **CHECK CONSOLE** - look for `conversationHistory` being logged
10. **PASTE CONSOLE OUTPUT HERE** ‚Üí Send to me

**What to Look For**:
- Does console show conversationHistory array?
- Does it include previous message?
- Is it passed to analyzeRequirements()?

**If Missing**: We'll fix the wiring immediately

---

### **TEST 2: Agent Extraction Accuracy** ‚ö° **DO SECOND**

**Goal**: Verify Agent extracts correctly from user input

**Steps**:
1. Clear browser console
2. Refresh page (clear conversation)
3. Enter: **"I need Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, and 512GB SSD storage"**
4. Press Send
5. **FIND IN CONSOLE**:
   ```
   [SimplifiedRespec] ‚úÖ Agent extracted: X requirements
   ```
6. **COPY THE FULL EXTRACTION OUTPUT** (should show 3 requirements)
7. **PASTE HERE** ‚Üí Send to me

**What to Look For**:
- Agent extracts 3 items: processor_type, memory_capacity, storage_capacity
- Each has correct value
- Confidence scores present

**If Wrong**: We'll fix the Agent extraction prompt

---

### **TEST 3: UC1 Matching Accuracy** ‚ö° **DO THIRD**

**Goal**: Verify SemanticMatchingService matches correctly

**Steps**:
1. Using same conversation from TEST 2
2. **FIND IN CONSOLE**:
   ```
   [SemanticMatching] üîç Matching X nodes to UC1
   [SemanticMatching] ‚úÖ Matched X nodes
   [SemanticIntegration] üìç Match: ...
   ```
3. **COPY ALL MATCH LOGS** showing:
   - What was matched
   - UC1 ID (e.g., spc001, spc003)
   - Confidence scores
4. **PASTE HERE** ‚Üí Send to me

**What to Look For**:
- Intel Core i7 ‚Üí spc001 (processor_type)
- 16GB RAM ‚Üí spc003 (memory_capacity)
- 512GB SSD ‚Üí storage-related spec

**If Wrong Matches**: We'll fix SemanticMatchingService prompt

---

### **TEST 4: Form Update Application** ‚ö° **DO FOURTH**

**Goal**: Verify form actually updates with correct values

**Steps**:
1. After TEST 3, **CHECK THE FORM ON SCREEN**
2. Look for these form fields:
   - **Processor Type**: Should show "Intel Core i7"
   - **Memory Capacity**: Should show "16GB"
   - **Storage Capacity**: Should show "512GB"
3. **TAKE SCREENSHOT** or **LIST WHAT ACTUALLY SHOWS**:
   ```
   Processor Type: _______
   Memory Capacity: _______
   Storage Capacity: _______
   ```
4. **SEND ME THE VALUES** ‚Üí What did it actually fill?

**What to Look For**:
- Values match what you said
- NO random values (like "wall mount")
- Form fields actually filled

**If Wrong**: We'll trace the form update path

---

### **TEST 5: Agent Form Visibility** ‚ö° **DO FIFTH**

**Goal**: Check if Agent knows what it filled

**Steps**:
1. In the SAME conversation (don't refresh)
2. Type: **"What form fields did you just fill?"**
3. Press Send
4. **COPY AGENT'S RESPONSE**
5. **PASTE HERE** ‚Üí Send to me

**What to Look For**:
- Agent should list: processor_type, memory_capacity, storage_capacity
- Values should match TEST 4

**If Agent Says "I didn't fill anything"**: We'll add form state visibility

---

### **TEST 6: Hallucination Check (Wall Mount Issue)** ‚ö° **DO SIXTH**

**Goal**: Reproduce "wall mount" hallucination

**Steps**:
1. Clear browser, refresh page
2. Enter: **"I need a compact industrial PC with good cooling"**
3. Press Send
4. **CHECK CONSOLE** for extractions and matches
5. **CHECK FORM** for any "mounting" field changes
6. **COPY**:
   - Console extraction logs
   - Console UC1 match logs
   - Form field values that changed
7. **PASTE HERE** ‚Üí Send to me

**What to Look For**:
- Did it extract "wall mount" when you didn't say it?
- Did UC1 matcher return mounting-related spec?
- Did form get updated with mounting value?

**If Hallucination Occurs**: We'll fix Agent prompt or UC1 matching
