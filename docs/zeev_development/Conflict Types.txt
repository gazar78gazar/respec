UC8 Conflict Types - Clarified Definitions
Context
Conflicts are detected when a new data node enters the MAPPED artifact and the system evaluates if it can safely move to the RESPEC artifact.

1. FIELD_OVERWRITE
Detection Trigger: New node in MAPPED could overwrite existing nodes in RESPEC
What It Means:
* NOT about form fields
* Detects when incoming node would replace/overwrite existing data nodes already in RESPEC
* Scans all potential overwrites before moving node from MAPPED ? RESPEC
Example:
RESPEC has: P82 = "Core i7"
MAPPED gets: P82 = "Core i9"
Conflict: Would overwrite existing P82 value

2. EXCLUSION
Detection Trigger: UC8 dataset mutual exclusion rules (107 rules total)
What It Means:
* Checks mutual/non-mutual exclusions at two levels: 
1. Direct: The data node itself conflicts with existing nodes
2. Hierarchical: Descendant nodes in lower hierarchies have exclusions
Example:
RESPEC has: P82 (High performance processor)
MAPPED gets: P27 (Low power <10W)
Conflict: UC8 rule says these are mutually exclusive

3. CASCADE
Detection Trigger: Dependency chains could cause overwrites
What It Means:
* When node enters MAPPED with "requires" dependencies
* System checks if required nodes (and THEIR exclusions) would create overwrites in RESPEC
* Prevents dependency-triggered conflicts before they happen
Example:
MAPPED gets: Feature X (requires Y and Z)
Y excludes: Node A (already in RESPEC)
Z excludes: Node B (already in RESPEC)
Conflict: Adding X would cascade into removing A and B

4. FIELD_CONSTRAINT
Detection Trigger: No valid options remaining after applying exclusions
What It Means:
* At least one specification in RESPEC has zero compatible options left
* All available "options" are excluded by other selections
* System becomes unsolvable
Example:
P82 options: ["Entry (Intel Atom)", "Standard (Core i3)", "Performance (Core i5)", 
              "Premium (Core i7)", "Extreme (Core i9)"]

Current exclusions eliminate: Atom, i3, i5, i7, i9
Result: P82 has no valid options remaining
Conflict: field_constraint - specification cannot be satisfied

All conflicts are evaluated before moving nodes from MAPPED to RESPEC, ensuring the RESPEC artifact remains consistent and valid at all times.
