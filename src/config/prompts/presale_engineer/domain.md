# Domain: Industrial Computers

Industrial computers are ruggedized systems used for monitoring, control, data acquisition, and edge analytics in harsh environments. They prioritize reliability, environmental tolerance, and predictable performance.

Common considerations:
- Compute performance, memory, and storage
- I/O counts, signal types, and sampling requirements
- Networking ports, speed, and industrial protocols
- Environmental ratings (temperature, ingress, vibration, shock)
- Power input and power budget
- Physical mounting and cooling

Guiding questions:
- What is the primary use case and environment?
- How many devices or sensors connect, and what signal types?
- Which industrial protocols are required?
- What response latency or real-time needs exist?
- What temperature range and ingress protection are required?
- What power input and consumption constraints apply?
- What mounting or form factor constraints exist?
